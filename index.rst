========

This addon has the following capabilities:

* Deploy, stop, shutdown, reboot, save, suspend, resume and delete VM's in the Virtual Data Centers hosted in vCloud.
* Create, delete and revert snapshots of VM's.
* Change RAM and CPU values of VM.
* It's able to hot-attach and detach NICs to VM's.
* Attach disks to VM, only in cold. To avoid accidental disk remove, the detach disk option is disabled in OpenNebula. If you want enable this option, see Guide section.
* Resize disks during the instantiation. Only increase the size, not decrease.
* Automatized customization of the VMs instanciated.
* It's able to choose wich storage profile will be storaged the VM's disk or disks.
* Port filtering via vShield during the VM instanciation.
* Obtain monitoring information from the VDC, Datastore and VM's.
* In this development version we manage vApps with one VMs inside (A VM in OpenNebula equals a vApp with one VM in vCloud).
* Each Virtual Data Center (VDC) in vCloud is managed as a Host in OpenNebula.
* Import networks, hosts, templates and datastores hosted in vCloud using onevcloud script.
